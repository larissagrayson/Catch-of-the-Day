**Catch of the Day**

**AUTHOR:**  Larissa Grayson

**DESCRIPTION:** This application was built as part of Wes Bos' *React for Beginners* [course](https://reactforbeginners.com/).

**OBJECTIVE:** The purpose of this course was to create a 'Fresh Fish Market' app using React.  It consists of two pages:
1. **Store Front:** This is the landing page where the user is presented with a text box to enter the name of their store or select a randomly generated one. 

2. **Main Store:**  This is where the user can look at the current fish available and choose what they would like to add to the their order.  The Main Store page is also built with authentication so that only the store owner can login and modify the inventory.  The order state is saved using localStorage and the inventory is saved using Firebase.

A live demo of the site can be found [here](https://catchoftheday.larissagrayson.vercel.app/) and [here](https://catchoftheday.larissagrayson.vercel.app/store/panicky-elegant-diagnoses).
